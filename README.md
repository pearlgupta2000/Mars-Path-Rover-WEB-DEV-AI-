## **Pathfinding Visualizer**<br/>
To determine the shortest distance between two points by using different AI Algorithms and adding obstacles in between <br/>
Patterns(for creating obstacles) - implemented some patterns(obstacles) like spiral pattern , stair pattern , recursion division . 


### **Meet the Algorithms**<br/>
This application supports the following algorithms:<br/>

>**Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path<br/>
>**A'*' Search** (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm<br/>
>**Breath-first Search** (unweighted): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path<br/>
>**Best-First Search**  Best-first search is a search algorithm which explores a graph by
expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule.<br/>
