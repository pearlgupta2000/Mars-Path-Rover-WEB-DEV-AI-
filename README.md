**Pathfinding Visualizer**<br/>

**Meet the Algorithms**<br/>
This application supports the following algorithms:

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path<br/>
**A'*' Search** (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm<br/>
**Breath-first Search** (unweighted): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path<br/>
**Best-First Search**  Best-first search is a search algorithm which explores a graph by
expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule.<br/>


**Technologies used** - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, AI Algorithms<br/>
