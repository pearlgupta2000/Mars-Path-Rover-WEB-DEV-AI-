***Pathfinding Visualizer***

***Meet the Algorithms***
This application supports the following algorithms:

***Dijkstra's Algorithm*** (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path
***A'*' Search*** (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm
***Breath-first Search*** (unweighted): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path
***Best-First Search***  Best-first search is a search algorithm which explores a graph by 
expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule.


***Technologies used*** - HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY
